      "A high-impact cross-linked polymer material with a Tg of 170Â°C",
      "A semi-crystalline thermoplastic material with a Tg of 160Â°C",
      "A cross-linked copolymer material with a Tg of -30Â°C",
      "A cross-linked polymer material with a Tg of -70Â°C",
      "A thermoplastic material with a Tg of -90Â°C",
      "An amorphous homopolymer material with a Tg of 40Â°C"

    "explanation": "<p>The correct answer is D. In a situation like this we need to ensure that the material can operate correctly under all the conditions it is exposed to. In this case it means being exposed to temperatures as low as -40Â°C when the rig is not in operation, and as high as 170Â°C while running. Under all of these conditions the system must remain strong and flexible. For the minimum operating temperature, that requires the glass transition temperature (Tg) to be below -40Â°C. If this were not the case the O-ring would likely become brittle and fracture under stress. This is part of what occurred with the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster in 1986.  This condition excludes A, B, C and F.</p><p>The material must also remain stable at high temperatures. In this case E would likely creep and soften as it is a thermoplastic which can (like PVC for example) remelt at temperatures near the maximum operating temperature of the oil rig. Material D being a cross-linked polymer or thermoset, is chemically bound together and while it can be burnt, it cannot be melted. Because their chains are bound together, cross-linked polymers are also far more resistant to creep.</p>",
