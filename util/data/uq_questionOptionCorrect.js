A similar problem is posed by <b>C</b>, while a thick polymer layer would slow down the process it would still eventually happen.</p><p>Option <b>D</b> is just too costly, as localised faults like this are very hard to pinpoint. This would require digging up a large portion of the line and replacing it. Making this option very costly and not desirable.</p>"
