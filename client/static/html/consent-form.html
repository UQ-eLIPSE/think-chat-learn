    <p>MOOCchat is designed to support peer learning around challenging problems or concepts. The tool is part of a collaborative
        teaching and learning research initiative with the University of California, Berkeley. We ask your permission to
        collect and analyse anonymous data from the MOOChat sessions to further investigate benefits to student learning,
        and to inform improvements to the system.</p>

    <p>All information will remain completely confidential. No identifying information from any of the data collected will be
        revealed to teaching staff or published. Participation in the research is voluntary and will have no impact on your
        ability to complete the assessment task and it will have no bearing on your marks or on your standing in the course.
        You have the right to withdraw your permission for your information to be used at any time.</p>

    <p>Please review the <button id="participant-info-sheet" class="neutral thin link">Participant Information Sheet (PDF)</button>,
        which provides further information about MOOCchat and the study.</p>

    <p><em>Please note that your consent or lack thereof does not impact on your ability to use MOOCchat as part of course assessment.</em></p>
