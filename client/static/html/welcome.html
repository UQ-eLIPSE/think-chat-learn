    <h2>Steps on using MOOCchat</h2>
    <ol class="welcome-instructions">
        <li>
            <h3>Answer a question</h3>
            <p>You'll be asked to respond to a concept-related question, as well as provide a confidence rating in your ability to explain the concept.</p>
            <p>Make sure you keep track of the timer for each section, which is visible to the left.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Discuss as a group and arrive at a best answer</h3>
            <p>After a brief wait, you'll be placed into a group chat to discuss other student answers.</p>
            <p>You should arrive at what the group believes is the best answer upon conclusion of the chat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Reflect on how you changed your thinking</h3>
            <p>You'll be asked to then provide a reflection of whether your answer changed and how.</p>
            <p>A second confidence rating also forms part of this.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Complete a brief survey</h3>
            <p>Before you complete the activity, we will ask a few questions about your MOOCchat experience.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
