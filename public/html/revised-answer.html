        <p>This is a real life question from a job interview.</p>
        <p>At present a company is experiencing an issue with ants exposing copper telecommunications lines. This results in
            failure of the lines connection. The cable used has a mass of 0.7kg/m and the line is planned to stretch to 100km
            between remote townships.</p>
        <p>The current price of copper is $7000/tonne and the value of plant equipment for this project is $2,000,000.</p>
        <p id="question-statement">Using your knowledge of design and materials, what solution from those below would you think was applied to prevent
            this ant damage from occurring?</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The application of a very thin steel foil layer to the cable to prevent the ants from eating into it. This
                    would be done by Electrophoretic deposition.</li>
                <li>The application of a thin, flexible ceramic layer to the cable to prevent the ants from eating into it. This
                    would be done by Electrophoretic deposition.</li>
                <li>The application of a thicker polymer sheath to the cable to prevent the ants from eating into it. This would
                    be done via fibre extrusion.</li>
                <li>No change to the material, it was decided that the best solution was to simply increase the frequency with
                    which the cables were replaced.</li>
