    <p>MOOCchat is an innovative, online peer-assisted learning tool designed to place students in small groups to engage discussion
        around high-level questions.</p>

    <p>As part of research into the benefits of online chats in peer-based student learning, we require permission for the collection
        of your MOOCchat session data, such as your answers and discussion messages.</p>

    <p>All information will remain completely confidential, and you may request to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

    <p>Please review the <button id="participant-info-sheet" class="neutral thin link">Participant Information Sheet (PDF)</button>,
        which provides further information about MOOCchat and the study.</p>

    <p><em>Please note that your consent or lack thereof does not impact on your ability to use MOOCchat as part of course assessment.</em></p>
