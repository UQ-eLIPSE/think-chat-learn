                <p>This is a real life question from a job interview.</p>
                <p>At present a company is experiencing an issue with ants exposing copper telecommunications lines. This results
                    in failure of the lines connection. The cable used has a mass of 0.7kg/m and the line is planned to stretch
                    to 100km between remote townships.</p>
                <p>The current price of copper is $7000/tonne and the value of plant equipment for this project is $2,000,000.</p>
                <p id="question-statement">Using your knowledge of design and materials, what solution from those below would you think was applied
                    to prevent this ant damage from occurring?</p>
            </div>
            <div id="chat-answers">
                <ul>
                    <li class="counter-purple">The application of a very thin steel foil layer to the cable to prevent the ants from eating into it.
                        This would be done by Electrophoretic deposition.</li>
                    <li class="counter-green">The application of a thin, flexible ceramic layer to the cable to prevent the ants from eating into it.
                        This would be done by Electrophoretic deposition.</li>
                    <li class="counter-blue">The application of a thicker polymer sheath to the cable to prevent the ants from eating into it. This
                        would be done via fibre extrusion.</li>
                    <li class="counter-red">No change to the material, it was decided that the best solution was to simply increase the frequency
                        with which the cables were replaced.</li>
                </ul>
