    <h2>Steps on using MoocChat:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Respond to a multiple-choice question covering the course material and provide a justification for your answer.</li>
        <li>Discuss the question answers from you and other students. You may need to wait briefly while a group is formed.
            <ul>
                <li>Try to learn from or help others so as to ensure that you all have a good understanding of the underlying
                    concepts, rather than just focusing on what the right answer might be. This will ensure that you maximise
                    the benefits to yourself and to your group from participating in the chat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Revise your response to the question based on the discussion.</li>
        <li>Fill out a brief questionnaire about your MoocChat experience.</li>
    </ol>
