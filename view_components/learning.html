                <p class="col-sm-11 h3">In this task, you'll learn a critical reasoning skill commonly called <em>identifying hidden assumptions</em>. Read the following carefully.
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-11 moocchat-plain-text">
                    You see arguments every day in statements by politicians, businesses, and advertisements.  These arguments are a way of trying to convince you that something is true. Here is an example:<br />
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-11 lead">
                    Many mobile phone companies protect their technology with patents, and mobile phones continue to become more technically advanced every year.   Therefore, patents lead to strong competition in the marketplace.
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-11 moocchat-plain-text">
                    This statement contains the key components of an argument: at least one <span class="text-warning">premise</span> and a <span class="text-success">conclusion</span>. But often there are gaps in logic  between the <span class="text-warning">premises</span> and the <span class="text-success">conclusion</span>. These gaps can include <span class="text-info">assumptions</span>, and identifying the unstated <span class="text-info">assumptions</span> helps you spot the logical flaw in the reasoning:
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-11 moocchat-reading well">
                    Premise(s) + Assumption(s) = Conclusion(s)
                </p>
                <p class="col-sm-11 moocchat-plain-text">
                    If the <span class="text-info">assumptions</span> are incorrect, then the conclusion might not follow.  There are several unstated or hidden <span class="text-info">assumptions</span> in the example above which may be not actually be true:
                </p>
                <ul class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 moocchat-plain-text">
                    <li class="moocchat-plain-text">
                        <span class="text-info">Assumption</span>: we have plenty of innovation in the presence of patents.
                        <ul class="moocchat-plain-text">
                            <li class="moocchat-plain-text">
                                Perhaps defending against patents takes away resources from making even more innovative inventions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="moocchat-plain-text">
                        <span class="text-info">Assumption</span>: strong competition is the biggest reason for the advanced technology in the mobile phone business.
                        <ul class="moocchat-plain-text">

                                 However, patents award a monopoly (exclusive rights) to the patent holder, thus reducing competition.

                <!-- With the decline of predators, such as wolves and coyotes, that used to keep the deer population within certain limits, deer have increased in numbers until they cannot feed themselves in the forest alone but must forage on open rangeland in competition with cattle. Thus, in areas where forest borders on rangeland, deer hunting is an essential activity. -->
                <!-- Tests demonstrating that the olfactory bulbs (relating to the sense of smell) of salmon will react upon exposure only to water from their spawning ground and no other water suggest the possibility that repeated exposure to a specific odorant of their spawning area during the first few weeks of life could stimulate olfactory receptor sites, increasing olfactory sensitivity to that single scent and influencing salmon migration to their spawning area. -->
                <!-- Epidemiologist: Malaria passes into the human population when a mosquito carrying the virus bites a human who has no immunity. The malaria parasite can remain for up to forty days in the blood of an infected person. The disease cannot be passed from person to person, unless a non-infected person is exposed to the blood of an infected person. Theoretically, malaria could be eradicated in any given area, if all the mosquitoes carrying malaria in that area are exterminated. If such a course of action is carried out at a worldwide level, then the global eradication of malaria is possible. -->
